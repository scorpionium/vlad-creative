# Voiceover Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

You're an excited, knowledgeable vinyl collector showing off a meaningful record — not a
salesman reading product specs. Think of a friend who's genuinely hyped about their new
pickup and wants to share why it matters.

- **Enthusiastic** but not over-the-top
- **Knowledgeable** — you know the band's history and the music
- **Conversational** — speak naturally, use contractions ("it's", "that's", "don't")
- **Opinionated** — share what makes this record special to fans

## Timing

**Target ~30 seconds of spoken text**, with **2-3 pauses of approximately 5 seconds each**
placed naturally between sections. Total audio including pauses: ~40-50 seconds.

The voiceover starts at the **3-second mark** in the video — the opening shot plays
silently with background music at full volume before the voice comes in. Design the
hook to feel like it arrives right on cue with the reveal of the cover.

The last ~10 seconds of the reel (turntable / beauty shot) will play with background
music only — no voiceover needed there.

Because the speech is condensed to ~30 seconds, every sentence needs to earn its place.
Pick the most interesting facts and leave the rest out. Depth over breadth.

## Structure Template

### 1. Hook (3-5s of speech)
Open with energy. Name the artist and album. Include the original language title if applicable.
Keep it short — just enough to hook the viewer.

Example: "Okay, check this out — Drudkh, Кров у наших криницях, Blood In Our Wells!"

### [pause — ~5s]

### 2. Album Significance + Band Context (8-10s of speech)
This is the most important section. Why does this album matter? What's special about
the music? Where does it sit in the band's discography? Include cultural or literary
context if applicable — this is what separates a great voiceover from a generic one.

Example: "Drudkh's fourth album, 2006 — for many fans, this is THE one. Long hypnotic
riffs layered with traditional Ukrainian melodies. Lyrics drawn from poetry by Symonenko."

### [pause — ~5s]

### 3. Edition Contents (7-9s of speech)
Cover the physical product with enthusiasm. Hit the highlights — don't just list specs.

Example: "And the packaging on this edition — deluxe gatefold with bronze foil,
12-page insert, double-sided poster, and an embroidered leather patch."

### [pause — ~5s, if using 3 pauses]

### 4. Vinyl Reveal + Closer (5-7s of speech)
Describe the vinyl variant — this is the visual payoff moment. Then a quick transition
to the music. Keep the closer casual and short.

Example: "Crystal clear, orange and red marbled — limited to 333 copies, foil-numbered.
Alright — let's hear it."

## Formatting Rules

- Use `[pause]` markers where the 5-second pauses should fall
- Don't use bullet points or lists — write it as continuous speech
- Include pronunciation notes for non-English words if needed
- Write the speech text only — no stage directions, no descriptions of what's on screen

## Bilingual Scripts

Write **both an English and a Ukrainian script**. The Ukrainian script is a full creative
adaptation — not a word-for-word translation. It should sound as natural and enthusiastic
in Ukrainian as the English version does in English. Adapt idioms and phrasing so they
land well for a Ukrainian-speaking audience.

Save as separate files:
- `voiceover_script_en.md` — English
- `voiceover_script_ua.md` — Ukrainian

## Script File Format

Use this template for both language versions:

```markdown
# <BAND NAME> — <Album>: Voiceover Script (<Language>)

**~30 seconds of speech + 2-3 pauses of ~5 seconds each**
Read with energy and enthusiasm. Pauses marked with [pause].

---

<voiceover text here, continuous speech with [pause] markers>

---

**Notes:**
- Spoken text: ~30 seconds
- Total with pauses: ~40-50 seconds
- Tone: excited, enthusiastic, knowledgeable
- <pronunciation guides for non-native words>
```

## Things to Avoid

- Don't pad to fill time — 30 seconds of tight, punchy writing beats 50 seconds of filler
- Don't open with "Hey guys" or "What's up everyone" — jump straight into the record
- Don't mention the video format ("in today's short" / "in this reel")
- Don't include a track listing — there's no time and it kills the energy
- Don't end with a call to action ("like and subscribe") — the subscribe overlay handles that
- Don't use superlatives for everything ("amazing", "incredible", "insane") — pick one moment
  to really emphasize
- Don't write the Ukrainian script as a literal translation — let it breathe naturally
